# CS542_prj
This is our final project of course CS542. The data we used can be publicly found at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/10601/projects.html

## Description
The goal of this project is to analyze the NBA Statistics in some machine learning ways. By saying analyzing, we tried to predict NBA results of 2003 based on related statistics of players, coaches and results of season games of previous years. Also, we tried to figure out the outliers of players using the playersâ€™ statistics. Besides, for specially exercising unsupervised learning technique, we clustered the players with statistics of their performance during season games. For the prediction part, we used techniques KNN, SVM and Decision Tree. We applied the DBSCAN clustering method to find the outliers. Then with the very common Kmeans++ we cluster the players to explore this famous unsupervised learning technique.
